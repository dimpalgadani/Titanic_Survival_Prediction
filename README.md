# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
**⭐ Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**

***🔹 Project Overview***

This project aims to predict the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning.
The goal is to analyze passenger characteristics and build a classification model capable of predicting survival outcomes.

***🔹 Data Preprocessing***

****Performed key preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for modeling:****
✔ Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
✔ Converted categorical columns using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding
✔ Selected relevant features for model input
✔ Split data into training and testing sets

***🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***

*****EDA was used to uncover survival patterns based on key variables:*****
📌 Females had a significantly higher survival rate
📌 1st Class passengers survived the most
📌 Younger passengers showed better chances of survival
📌 Visualizations included bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and boxplots

***🔹 Model Evaluation***

The model was evaluated using performance metrics:

Accuracy Score

The model showed stable performance and captured major survival patterns effectively.

***🔹 Conclusion***

The Titanic dataset demonstrated how demographic and travel features influence survival probability.
The Logistic Regression model provided interpretable insights and reliable predictions.
Key takeaway: Gender, Class, Age, and Fare were the strongest predictors of survival.
